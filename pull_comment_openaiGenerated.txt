{"post_id": 1527985424, "text": "Just getting into the Github community.  I was looking up billiard sims with ChatGPT and this is what came up: There are several WebGL billiard simulators available online. One example is pooltool, an open-source sandbox billiards game that emphasizes realistic physics. It is designed for both gamers and researchers. Gamers can play different styles of pool (8-ball, 9-ball, etc.) in a 3D-rendered environment that emphasizes physical realism. [Researchers interested in pool physics, game theory, camera-projector systems, AI, robotics, and other billiards-related research topics can efficiently simulate shots using pooltool\u2019s API, experiment with different physics models and shot evolution algorithms, and visualize programmatically-defined shots](https://ekiefl.github.io/projects/pooltool/)[1](https://ekiefl.github.io/projects/pooltool/)", "html": "https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool/pull/75#issuecomment-1527985424", "labels": ["Unrelated"]}
